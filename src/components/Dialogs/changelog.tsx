									<strong>Urban Dictionary Syllable Concatenation:</strong> When fetching from Urban Dictionary, if multiple syllables or words are selected, they are now automatically combined into a single query term. This is especially useful for slang words that are split across multiple timing segments.
								</Text>
								<Text size="2">
									<strong>Header Glassmorphism Overhaul:</strong> Fixed inconsistent blur effects in the top bar area. The TitleBar and RibbonBar are now unified with a robust glassmorphism effect, featuring improved backdrop-filter settings (<code>blur(16px) saturate(160%)</code>) and matching semi-transparent backgrounds (<code>var(--gray-a5)</code>).

									<strong>Integrated Header Layout:</strong> Removed margins from the RibbonBar card and unified its style with the TitleBar to create a single, cohesive blurred header area.

									<strong>AMLL Preview Mode:</strong> Added a dedicated high-fidelity <strong>AMLL</strong> preview mode powered by the local Apple Music-like lyrics rendering engine, featuring a fluid Mesh Gradient background running at 60 FPS. The mode now correctly fills the entire preview window with the background properly rendered.
								</Text>
								<Text size="2">
									<strong>Background Vocal Grouping (Standard Mode):</strong> Main and background vocal lines are rendered as a single unified visual block. When a line becomes active, both the main vocal and its BG vocal(s) scale up together — matching official Apple Music behavior. BG vocals appear in italic beneath the main line with word-level highlighting.
								</Text>
								<Text size="2">
									<strong>Promotion-based Rendering Architecture:</strong> Inactive lyric lines are now rendered as static, near-zero-cost elements with no real-time subscriptions. Only the active line promotes to full dynamic rendering, reducing React reconciliation work by ~95% and eliminating word-transition lag.
								</Text>
								<Text size="2">
									<strong>GPU-First Acceleration:</strong> Applied <code>translate3d</code>, <code>backface-visibility: hidden</code>, <code>content-visibility: auto</code>, and <code>will-change</code> hints across all lyric lines to maximize GPU compositing, minimize CPU usage, and enable DOM culling for off-screen lines.
								</Text>
								<Text size="2">
									<strong>Removed "Rendered" Mode:</strong> Consolidated the legacy Rendered AMLL preview into the new AMLL mode. The preview selector now cleanly presents: <strong>Standard</strong>, <strong>AMLL</strong>, and <strong>Timing</strong>.
								</Text>
								<Text size="2">
									<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Fixed a Jotai "Atom is undefined" crash, fixed the AMLL background appearing solid black due to a z-index layering conflict, and fixed lyric auto-scroll snapping to the top on every line change.

								</Text>
								<Text size="2">
									<strong>Developer Preferences Tab:</strong> Introduced a dedicated "Dev" category in the Preferences dialog to house advanced technical features, plugin management, and system debug information. Access it to manage your community extensions or check build environments.

									<strong>Automated Lyrics Prep Engine:</strong> Completely replaced the external <code>Lyrprep</code> dependency with a built-in, local processing engine. The new <strong>"Process Lyrics"</strong> button handles background vocal splitting, space escaping (<code>\ </code>), and hyphen splitting (<code>sh-\sh-</code>) on the spot without leaving the app.
								</Text>
								<Text size="2">
									<strong>Syllable-Level Alignment:</strong> Refined the processing logic to match professional synchronization standards. It automatically converts plain text into a syllable-sync-ready format with escaped spaces and hyphens, saving hours of manual formatting.
