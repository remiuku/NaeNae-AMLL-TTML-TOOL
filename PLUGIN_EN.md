# AMLL TTML Tools Plugin Overview / Development Guide (WIP)

Due to growing diverse requirements and to keep the tool itself from becoming too bloated and complex while satisfying special needs in more scenarios, a set of lyric tool plugin interface specifications for AMLL TTML Tools has been established to meet the special needs of lyric creators as much as possible.

## Overview

Plugins are implemented based on the Extism plugin framework, allowing development in multiple languages and compiled to WASM for use by AMLL TTML Tools. For details, refer to the [Extism official website](https://extism.org/).

The following features are expected to be available:

- Access to all lyric data, with the ability to view and modify lyrics and create edit history points (for undo/redo).
- Listen to various user lyric operation events (editing words, setting timestamps (timing)).
- Create extension dropdown menu items with callbacks for user interaction.
- Display form inputs to users for more customizable operation configurations.
- Display notification boxes and progress bars to keep users informed of the current operation status.

## Function Prototype Description Explanation

According to the Extism architecture, the interface documentation describes functions in the following format:

```
ReturnValue FunctionName(Parameters)
```

Unless otherwise specified, return values and parameters are JSON strings, and the data structures for JSON objects are detailed later.

### Data Types

- `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64` - Common integer numeric types.
- `String` - A pointer to a string, terminated with a NULL null value.
- Types other than the above (e.g., `LyricLine`) - Data structures stored as JSON strings.
- Types with **square brackets** (e.g., `LyricLine[]`) - **Array** data structures stored as JSON strings.

## Plugin Function Definitions

### Plugin Lifecycle Functions

All of the following functions must be defined:

| Function Prototype            | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `void plugin_on_load(void)`   | `true`   | Called when the plugin is loaded. This is the first function called.        |
| `void plugin_on_unload(void)` | `true`   | Called when the plugin is unloaded. This is the last function called.       |

### Plugin Event Functions

The following functions are optional. AMLL TTML Tools will automatically call them based on whether the function definition is registered.

| Function Prototype                             | Required | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `void event_on_lyric_update(LyricUpdateEvent)` | `false`  | Triggered when the user operates any lyric data (does not include modifications to lyrics from plugins).      |
| `void event_on_undo(void)`                     | `false`  | Triggered when the user performs an undo operation.                                                           |
| `void event_on_redo(void)`                     | `false`  | Triggered when the user performs a redo operation.                                                           |
| `void event_on_click_plugin_menu_item(String)` | `false`  | Triggered when the user clicks a menu item in the plugin menu. Parameter is the string menu ID defined at registration. |

## Host Function Definitions

The following host functions can be called within any plugin function definition as needed to achieve required extended functionality.

### Lyric Editing Related

| Function Prototype            | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LyricLine[] lyric_get(void)` | Get the full text data of the current lyrics. Returns a JSON string representing `LyricLine[]`. |
| `void lyric_set(LyricLine[])` | Set the lyric data currently being edited. Parameter is a JSON string representing `LyricLine[]`. |
| `void lyric_record(void)`     | Record a snapshot of the current lyric editing state for user undo/redo operations.      |
